# Tower of Hanoi
## A Recursive Solver! *(And Graphics Driver!)*

# Why'd You Make This... Thing? You're *Reinventing The Wheel*
I wanted to challenge myself and figure out what all that jazz about *recursion* was really about. Up until this project, recursion was kinda funky. Now, it's slightly less funky

# But What Are These *Things?*
- *HanoiGame.java* is the Main Driver; it'll draw the graphics and whatnot.
- *Ring.java* makes up the Ring Object; this fella not only shows what to draw, but *also* carries the methods needed to move itself (as an individual)
- *Solver.java* is... well, it's the *solver.* This is the guy that implements the recursive solution, and is called within *HanoiGame.java*

# How Do I Try This Out?
Fire up a current(-ish) version of your Eclipse IDE, and stick these *.java* files into a new Java Project.
</br>*Name it something cool. For me, your friend.*
</br>Then, hit 'Run' (or fn+F11); Pull up the Console, and hit 
>Enter

That'll step through each step. Press and hold
>Enter

For a mind-melding journey through recursion
>Enjoy!

You may be wondering why I didn't export this as an executable. I, too, wonder.
</br>Y'See, I, midst the throes of a late-night figuring-out-how-to-make-rectangles-appear-on-the-screen-session that simply *couldn't* wait, decided that implementing a MouseHandler to click through the solver's steps would make the project take far too long just to try out the *main attraction*â€”namely, the *recursive solver*

# Fine, But How Does It *Solve?*
A wise fella once said
>I dunno

I am not that wise fella; nor am I a wise fella. But y'know what? Let me give you a quick breakdown:
